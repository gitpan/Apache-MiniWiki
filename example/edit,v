@Writing pages

Writing and creating pages is simple. If you see a page that you wish to change, just press the "Edit" link. You will then receive a page where you can edit the information. When you subsequently press "Submit", having done your changes, the page is updated on the server.

Instead of using regular HTML code, all content is written as plain text which is formatted into HTML when viewed. 

The following is true for all pages:

 * The first line on any page will always become a header
 * If you wish to link to other pages, you can write links like this: \[\[Pagename|Description]]. For example, to make a link to the main page (index), you can write: \[\[index|Main page]].
 * You can create *bold* or _underlined_ text by putting * or _ on both sides of a text.
 * Unnumbered lists (like this) is written by putting *, in front of all rows.
 * Numbered lists are written by putting a number (1, 2, 3...) in front of every row.
 * Three dashes or more after each other produces a horizontal line across the page.

If someone creates a link to a page that doesn't exist yet, it will be shown by a small questionmark following the description. By pressing the questionmark, a blank page is received where one can create the page.
