@Welcome

Welcome to your first Apache::MiniWiki installation. This installation doesn't
contain very much and is waiting for you to add content to it. You can start
by modifying the [[template]] page, or perhaps take a look at how to [[edit]]
pages.

If you wish, you can also create your own [[playground]] by clicking on the
questionmark after the word playground to create that missing page.

See the provided documentation for further information on customizing your MiniWiki install. For an example of a working MiniWiki site, see http://www.nyetwork.org/wiki/@
