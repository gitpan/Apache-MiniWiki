NAME
    Apache::MiniWiki - Miniature Wiki for Apache

SYNOPSIS
    Add this to httpd.conf:

      <Location /wiki>
         PerlAddVar datadir "/home/foo/db/wiki/"
         PerlAddVar vroot "/wiki"
         PerlAddVar authen "/home/foo/db/htpasswd"
         SetHandler perl-script
         PerlHandler Apache::MiniWiki

         AuthType Basic
         AuthName "Sample Wiki"
         AuthUserFile /home/foo/db/htpasswd 
         Require valid-user
      </Location>

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires these other modules:

      Apache::Htpasswd;
      Apache::Constants;
      CGI;
      HTML::FromText;
      HTML::Template;
      Rcs;

ALTERNATIVE SYNOPSIS
    Apache::MiniWiki can also be called by an Apache::Registry CGI script.
    By running it in this manner, absolutely no changes need to be made to
    the web server's httpd.conf, as long as Apache has mod_perl built in.

    Copy the example wiki.cgi into your CGI directory and assign it the
    appropriate permissions. Edit wiki.cgi and set the datadir and vroot
    variables:

    $r->dir_config->add(datadir => '/home/foo/db/wiki/');
    $r->dir_config->add(vroot => '/perlcgi/wiki.cgi');

    Note #1: This may be a great way of integrating Apache::MiniWiki into an
    existing site that already has it's own header/footer template system.

    Note #2: This method assumes that the site administrator is already
    using Apache::Registry to speed up CGI's on the site. If they aren't,
    have them set up mod_perl as it was meant to be. See the mod_perl guide,
    or try this:

      ScriptAlias /perlcgi /path/to/your/cgi-bin/
      <Location /perlcgi>
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler Apache::Registry
        Options ExecCGI
      </Location>

DESCRIPTION
    Apache::MiniWiki is an simplistic Wiki for Apache. It doesn't have much
    uses besides very simple installations where hardly any features are
    needed. What is does support though is:

      - storage of Wiki pages in RCS
      - templates through HTML::Template
      - text to HTML conversion with HTML::FromText
      - basic authentification password changes
      - ability to view any revision of a page
      - ability to revert back to any revision of the page
      - basic checks to keep search engine spiders from deleting 
        all the pages in the Wiki!!!

    If you want to use your own template for MiniWiki, you should place the
    template in the RCS file template,v in the "datadir". Upon execution,
    MiniWiki will check out this template and use it. If you make any
    modifications to the RCS file, a new version will be checked out.

    You can modify the template from within MiniWiki by visiting the URL
    http://your.server.name/your-wiki-vroot/(edit)/template

    If you don't install a template, a default one will be used.

    The "datadir" variable defines where in the filesystem that the RCS
    files that MiniWiki uses should be stored. This is also where MiniWiki
    looks for a template to use.

    The "vroot" should match the virtual directory that MiniWiki runs under.

    If this variable is set, it should point to a standard htpasswd file
    which MiniWiki has write access to. The function to change a users
    password is then enabled.

    If you create the pages 'list' or 'listchanges', the following will
    automatically get appended to them:

     - list:        A simple line deliminated list of 
                    all the pages in the system

     - listchanges: Ordered by date, gives a list of all pages 
                    including the last comment, the number of lines 
                    added or removed, and the date of the last change

    To keep things sane and reasonable, the master 'template' page does not
    show up in any of these three page listings.

    Spiders for search engines (Google, OpenFind, etc) love the bounty of
    links found in a Wiki. Unfortunely, they also follow the Archive,
    Changes, View, and Revert links. This not only adds to the load on your
    webserver, but there is a very high chance that pages will get rolled
    back as the spider goes in circles following links. This has happened!
    Add these links to your robots.txt so that robots can only view the
    actual current pages:

    Disallow: /wiki/(edit)/ Disallow: /wiki/(log)/ Disallow: /wiki/(revert)/
    Disallow: /wiki/(save)/ Disallow: /wiki/(view)/ Disallow:
    /wiki/lastchanges

    See http://www.nyetwork.org/wiki for an example of this module in active
    use.
