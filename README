Apache::MiniWiki version 0.20
=============================

Apache::MiniWiki is an increadibly simplistic Wiki server for Apache.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

Then configure your Apache server by putting something like this
in its configuration:

  <Location /wiki>
     PerlAddVar datadir "/home/foo/db/wiki/"
     PerlAddVar vroot "/wiki"
     SetHandler perl-script
     PerlHandler Apache::MiniWiki
  </Location>

The datadir should point to a directory where Apache can write.
The vroot should match the <Location>. You should then visit
the URL http://server.name/wiki/(edit)/index to create a first
index page. An example datadir is included in the distribution
in the directory example/ which you can use if you wish.
